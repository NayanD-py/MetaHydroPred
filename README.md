# MetaHydroPred
MetaHydroPred is a meta-learning framework for predicting current density and H₂ production rate in microbial electrochemical cells (MECs). The framework combines predictions from multiple baseline models using a stacked meta-model to improve robustness across heterogeneous substrate conditions.
